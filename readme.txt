 컴 INTRODUCTION 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

 Boot Navigator (BN) is such a program which allows you boot operating system
 (OS) from any of your primary partitions. Currently supported partition types
 are:
    FAT12 (DOS)
    NTFS  (NT)
    FAT32 (Win9x)
    4F    (QNX)
    Ext2  (Linux)

 If you want to boot from any other partition just change code of BN because
 source code is distributed with program.

 BN works in such a way:
    Finds all known (mentioned above) partitions and displays them.
    User can choose (by pressing 1, 2 or other numeric key) from which
     partition to boot.
     WARNING: If user press key for which coresponding patition doesn't exist
     (for example 6, but you have only 2 partitions) BN behavior is
     unpredictable.
    If user do not choose within 6 seconds Boot Navigator boots OS form
     the first partition.
